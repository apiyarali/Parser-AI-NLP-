# Sentence Parser AI

This project implements a parser AI capable of parsing English sentences and extracting noun phrases using context-free grammar (CFG). The AI analyzes sentence structure and extracts noun phrase chunks, providing insights into the sentence's grammatical structure.

## Overview

Parsing is an essential task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the structure of a sentence. A parser can identify parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and understand how they relate to one another within the sentence. The goal of this project is to create a parser that can analyze simple English sentences and extract noun phrases using context-free grammar.

The system uses a context-free grammar to parse sentences and then extracts noun phrases that provide a better understanding of the sentence's meaning.

### Example Output

```bash
$ python parser.py
Sentence: Holmes sat.
        S
   _____|___
  NP        VP
  |         |
  N         V
  |         |
holmes     sat

Noun Phrase Chunks
holmes
```

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Install the required dependencies by running:
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
- nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit is used for tokenization and parsing

### Files and Directories
- **sentences/:** Contains a collection of English sentences to be parsed.
- **parser.py:** The main script that implements the parser.
- **requirements.txt:** A file listing project dependencies.

### How to Run
To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python parser.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a sentence, and the program will parse it and extract noun phrase chunks.

### Example Interaction:
```bash
$ python parser.py
Sentence: Holmes sat.
        S
   _____|___
  NP        VP
  |         |
  N         V
  |         |
holmes     sat

Noun Phrase Chunks
holmes
```

## Implementation Details
### Functions
- **preprocess(sentence):** Tokenizes and processes a sentence, returning a list of lowercase words, excluding any non-alphabetic characters.
- **np_chunk(tree):** Given a syntactic tree (generated by the parser), extracts noun phrase chunks (subtrees with the label NP) and returns a list of those noun phrase chunks.
- **NONTERMINALS:** A set of context-free grammar rules that define how sentences and noun phrases are structured. The rules are defined as transformations of nonterminal symbols like S (sentence) and NP (noun phrase).

### Grammar Rules
The grammar follows a context-free grammar format, where each rule defines how symbols can be rewritten. For example:

**`S -> NP VP`**: A sentence **`(S)`** consists of a noun phrase **`(NP)`** followed by a verb phrase **`(VP)`**.

**`NP -> N | Det N`**: A noun phrase **`(NP)`** can be a single noun **`(N)`** or a determiner **`(Det)`** followed by a noun **`(N)`**.

These rules allow the parser to understand simple English sentences and extract noun phrases.

### Example Workflow
1. **Preprocessing:** The sentence is tokenized into lowercase words using nltk.word_tokenize.
2. **Parsing:** The sentence is parsed using the defined grammar rules, producing a syntactic tree.
3. **Noun Phrase Extraction:** The np_chunk function extracts noun phrases from the syntactic tree and outputs them.

### Customization
- **Grammar Modification:** You can modify the context-free grammar rules in the NONTERMINALS variable to handle more complex sentences or improve parsing accuracy.
- 
- **Sentence Files:** You can add or remove sentences in the sentences/ directory to test the parser on different types of input.

## Notes
- This parser can handle basic English sentences, but it may generate multiple parse trees for grammatically ambiguous sentences.
  
- The grammar rules in this project are relatively simple and can be extended to support more complex sentence structures.

- The noun phrase chunking function ensures that only noun phrases without nested noun phrases are returned, providing cleaner and more accurate results.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic NLP parser that analyzes the structure of sentences and extracts noun phrases. While the grammar is simple, the parser can be extended and refined to handle more complex linguistic structures and edge cases.
